# ParenthesesMatching
My implementation of a parenthesis matching algorithm using the Stack abstract data type. Algorithm checks to see if parentheses in an 
arithmetic expression are well balanced. 

The inputed arithmetic expression must include parenthesis in order to work.

The algorithm does not consider other ways in which expression could be malformed. It only checks if parentheses are balanced. For instance
(2++++3) would be considered balanced.
